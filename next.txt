GPC & Find Peers Implementation
Goal
Implement the "Find Peers" functionality in GPC to:

Actually save the found peers to the form.
Calculate median multiples from peers.
Auto-populate "Applied Multiples" fields in the form (new fields).
Have the backend use these applied multiples for valuation.

Add optional 
ev_revenue_multiple
 and 
ev_ebitda_multiple
 to 
GPCInput
.
[MODIFY]

Update logic to use provided multiples if available, otherwise fallback to internal calculation.
Frontend Changes
[MODIFY] 
frontend/src/components/ManualEntryForm.tsx
Update "Find Peers" handler to:
Update gpc_input.peer_tickers with found tickers.
Calculate medians and update gpc_input.ev_revenue_multiple and 
ev_ebitda_multiple
.
add Input fields for these multiples so user can see/edit them.
