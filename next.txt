Create BusinessAlerts: Stop alerting on "High Latency" and start alerting on "Valuation dropped > 10%".
Structure the Verdict: Change 
AIReportService
 to output a structured field: recommendation: "BUY" | "SELL" | "HOLD", and display this as a giant badge on the UI.
Confidence Score: Show the "85% Confidence" score right next to the valuation number, calculated from your 
SuggestionService
.

No, this is not happening in your project yet.

Your current 
AlertService
 in 
backend/services/alerting/service.py
 is extremely basic. It is a "System Monitor," not a "Business Intelligence Engine."

1. What You Have vs. What You Need
Feature	Current Reality (
alerting/service.py
)	What You Asked For
Logic	"Is latency > 500ms?" (DevOps check)	"Did Portfolio Value drop > 10%?" (Partner check)
Thresholds	Hardcoded global env vars (ALERT_P95...)	Per-Partner Thresholds (e.g., "Partner A cares about 5% drop, Partner B cares about 15%")
Delivery	Prints to Console (print())	Suppression & Cooldown ("Don't email me 50 times an hour")
Memory	None. Fire and forget.	Acknowledge Loop ("I saw this, I fixed it, don't alert again").
2. The Missing "institutional memory"
You do not have an Alerts table in your database, nor do you have an API to "Acknowledge" or "Resolve" them.

Current State: If the system detects an error, it prints it. If it happens again 1 second later, it prints it again.
Desired State: Alert functionality needs to be a Workflow, not just a notification.
3. Immediate Action Plan
